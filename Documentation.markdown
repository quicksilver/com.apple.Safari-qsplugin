## Catalog ##

The Safari plug-in allows you to index your Safari bookmarks and history. You can locate these items by searching in Quicksilver, or by selecting Safari and hitting → or /.

It also provides access to all currently open pages. Select "Open Web Pages" in the first pane and hit → or /.

### Proxy Objects ###

There are two proxy objects: Current Web Page and Current Website

Current Web Page gives you quick access to the URL of the active window/tab in Safari.

Current Website adds a new Web Search to your catalog that allows you to search (using Google) the entire site currently active in Safari.
